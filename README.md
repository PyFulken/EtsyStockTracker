# EtsyStockTracker
 
Small personal project to help a friend keep stock track of all the things needed to run a new Etsy shop.

Started extremely complex for a project that could simply be boiled down to manipulating a JSON file.
Tkinter forced my hand to create some really shoddy dictionary shenanigans in order to be able to refresh the amount
labels, something I expected the StringVar() functionality to do automatically.

Done both as a favor, code learning and coding exercise, alongside git exercise and beginning my (humble) portfolio building.
